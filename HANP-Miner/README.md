#### Abstract:
 Nonoverlapping sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a kind of repetitive SPM with gap constraints, which can make a balance between effectiveness and efficiency and mine more valuable patterns. However, current researches focus on mining frequent patterns or closed patterns, resulting in some low-frequency but extremely important patterns being ignored. To tackle this issue, this paper addresses high average-utility nonoverlapping sequential pattern (HANP) mining. We propose an effective algorithm, named HANP-Miner, which involves in two key steps, support calculation and candidate pattern pruning. To calculate the support, a depth-first search and backtracking strategies based on the simplified Nettree is adopted, which effectively reduces the time and space complexity of the algorithm. To reduce the candidate patterns effectively, the pattern growth strategy based on average utility upper bound method is proposed. Experiments on various data verify the efficiency of HANP-Miner and the superiority of HANPs. These include biological sequences mining and real sales sequences analysis. The results validate that that not only is HANP-Miner more efficient, but also the HANPs mined are more valuable and desirable than the existing frequent patterns. This study expands the semantics and application fields of SPM. The algorithms and data can be downloaded https://github.com/wuc567.
