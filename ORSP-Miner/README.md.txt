#### Abstract:

 Rare sequential pattern mining (SPM) is an important research topic in the area of SPM. Unlike frequent SPM, rare SPM can find abnormal but vital patterns in sequential databases, and therefore plays a unique role in real-world scenarios such as anomaly detection and disease detection. However, existing methods generally ignore the repetitions of a pattern, which can be related to the degree of interest of the user. To solve this problem, this paper presents a one-off rare sequential pattern (ORSP) mining scheme, and proposes the ORSP-Miner algorithm. To reduce the number of candidate patterns, ORSP-Miner employs a pattern join strategy and a pruning strategy called Sup-Prune. To improve the efficiency of support calculation, we use an inverted index dictionary and design two ending strategies. To verify the performance of ORSP-Miner, seven competitive algorithms and 16 databases are considered. Our experimental results show that ORSP-Miner outperforms the other algorithms.
