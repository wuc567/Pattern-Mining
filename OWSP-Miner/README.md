#### Abstract:

 Gap constraint sequential pattern mining (SPM), as a kind of repetitive SPM that can avoid mining too many useless patterns. However, this method is difficult for users to set a suitable gap without prior knowledge and each character is considered to have the same effects. To tackle these issues, this paper addresses a self-adaptive one-off weak-gap strong pattern (OWSP) mining. The method adaptively determines the gap according to the sequence, and the pattern is composed of strong characters while weak characters are allowed in the gap. To handle this problem, this paper proposes OWSP-Miner, which adopts the reverse order filling strategy to effectively calculate the support and employs the pattern growth strategy to effectively reduce the candidate patterns. For clarification, time series were employed in the experiments and the results show that OWSP-Miner is not only more efficient but also is easier for mining valuable patterns.
